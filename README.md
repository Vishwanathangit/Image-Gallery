🖼️ Simple Image Gallery

This is a basic and responsive Image Gallery project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Users can click on any image to view it in a larger popup and can easily close the popup view.

This project helped me understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and creating an interactive UI experience using pure JavaScript.
